# What is it?
This is a Java wrapper for the [Elixir Music](https://ponjo.club/invites/elixir) Discord bot's HTTP API.

# How to Use
There is no documentation for the wrapper:tm: but the code is self-explainatory.
Documentation will be added soon:tm: in the form of comments and on the [Wiki](https://github.com/KingRainbow44/Elixir-API/wiki).
